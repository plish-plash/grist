# Grist

Grist is a collection of libraries for creating games with Rust.

* `grist` is a small library that defines `Obj<T>`, which works like `Arc<RwLock<T>>` but has some added functionality.
* `silica` is a retained-mode GUI system.
* `gristmill` is a game engine. It uses [`miniquad`](https://crates.io/crates/miniquad) for rendering.
